The **Garden Sage** provides broad based experience and a belief in the utilization of ecological practices and services that inform the public and organizations on issues related to food production, nutrition, sustainability and the environment. We use restorative practices to guide gardeners, growers, landscape designers, and builders on a path to becoming environmental stewards.

We embrace the beauty of the natural world in ways that inform our
efforts to encourage its preservation.
